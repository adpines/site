# About me

I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford in the [Williams PanLab](https://williamspanlab.com/) researching how cognition and psychopathology interact in the developing brain. I recently completed a neuroscience PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with Ted Satterthwaite, where I studied normative neurocognitive development. Out of respect for the complexity of the developing brain, I integrate across structural and functional neuroimages at multiple scales of analysis for broad and robust responses to my research questions. Out of respect for the scientific community, I've created walkthroughs for all code subserving my published analyses since 2018. Outside of neuroscience, I am recently a lucky fiancé and a long-time mediocre improvisational musician, enjoy backpacking trips into the mountains with friends, and am active in the great American folk science of meat smoking.

_"Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethics or political philosophy); it is the front trench in the siege of truth. Science is the captured territory; and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and marvelous world" - Durant_
